# TSEffect
This is a plug-in developed in Unity2020.3.14 that provides a framework to help managing both visual and nonvisual effects, reducing the coupling degree of the project.
You can extend the class TSEffectTemplate to create your own effects; there are examples under the folder TSEffect/Effect
